# pyali
A library for manipulating multiple sequence alignments (bioinformatics, structural biology)

# Quickstart
We recommend you install `pyali` into its own virtual environment.

For example, if you use `pyenv`, you would execute the following commands:
* `pyenv virtualenv 3.8.2 pyali-3.8.2`
* `pyenv activate pyali-3.8.2`
* `python setup.py install` OR `pip install .`

You may also install `pyali` into an existing virtual environment for another project:
* `pyenv activate YOUR-PROJECT`
* `python setup.py install` OR `pip install .`
